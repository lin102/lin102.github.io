	<p id="asian_text">In 2008, the IUCN listed the Asian elephant as endangered due to a 50% population decline over the past 60 to 75 years. 
	Asian elephants once ranged from Syria and Iraq to China (up to the Yellow River) and Java. 
	It is now extinct in these areas and the current range of Asian elephants is highly fragmented.
	The total population of Asian elephants is estimated to be around 40,000 to 50,000, although this may be a loose estimate. 
	It is likely that around half of the population is in India.

		<p id="african_text">In 1979, Africa had an estimated minimum population of 1.3 million elephants, 
		with a possible upper limit of 3.0 million; by 1989, the population was estimated to be 609,000.
		Conversely, studies in 2005 and 2007 found populations in eastern and southern Africa were increasing by an average annual rate of 4.0%.
		The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) estimates a total of around 440,000 individuals for 2012. 
		African elephants receive at least some legal protection in every country where they are found, but 70% of their range exists outside protected areas. 
		Successful conservation efforts in certain areas have led to high population densities. Large efforts are taken to raise awareness of the value of elephants, 
		to help mitigate human-elephant conflicts, and to promote anti-poaching activities.</p>
